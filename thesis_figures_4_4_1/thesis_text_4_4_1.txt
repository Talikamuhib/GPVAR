SECTION 4.4.1: LTI GP-VAR Model Selection (P, K) and Fit
================================================================================

METHODS TEXT:
-------------
We performed model selection over P ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 30} and 
K ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 
with stability constraints (spectral radius ρ < 1). The optimal model order (P, K) 
was selected independently for each subject to minimize BIC while ensuring 
model stability.

RESULTS TEXT - Model Selection:
-------------------------------
Model selection revealed similar autoregressive orders across groups. For the 
AD group (n=35), the median selected P was 5 
(IQR: [5, 7]), while for the HC group 
(n=31), the median P was 7 
(IQR: [5, 8]). 
This difference was not statistically significant 
(t = -0.446, p = 0.6574, 
Cohen's d = -0.110).

For the graph filter order K, the AD group showed a median of 2 
(IQR: [2, 3]), compared to 
3 (IQR: [2, 3]) 
for the HC group (t = -0.814, 
p = 0.4192).

RESULTS TEXT - Model Fit:
-------------------------
The LTI GP-VAR models achieved good predictive accuracy across both groups. 
The coefficient of determination (R²) for the AD group was 0.503 
(median; IQR: [0.466, 0.573]), compared to 
0.531 (median; IQR: [0.497, 0.574]) 
for the HC group. No significant difference in R² was observed between groups 
(t = -0.894, p = 0.3746, 
Cohen's d = -0.219).

Mean squared error (MSE) was 0.454 
(median; IQR: [0.436, 0.503]) for AD and 
0.454 (median; IQR: [0.427, 0.477]) 
for HC (t = 1.023, p = 0.3100).

INTERPRETATION:
---------------
The similar model orders selected for both groups suggest comparable temporal dynamics complexity in AD and HC.
The comparable R² values indicate that the GP-VAR framework captures EEG dynamics equally well in both clinical populations, supporting its utility for group comparisons.
